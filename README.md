# Thermal Detonator

********** 
GENERAL DESCRIPTION

 The idea of this project is to replicate the looks of a detonator by using an Arduino microcontroller board. To this we connect a micro switch, DFPlayer Mini module (to witch the speaker is connected) and LEDs such that when the switch is pressed, the LEDs will light up in a specific order as well as the speaker will be emitting a particular sound, both of this signifying the start of an arming sequence for a detonator. We will also connect to the Arduino microcontroller a vibration/ movement sensor module SW-420, so that when the detonator is thrown and it hits an object, the previous sequence will change, meaning the LEDâ€™s will all be on at the same time and the speaker will emit an explosion sound.
