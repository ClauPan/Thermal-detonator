# Thermal Detonator

## GENERAL DESCRIPTION

 The idea of this project is to replicate the looks of a Star Wars detonator by using an Arduino microcontroller board. When the switch is pressed, the LEDs will light up in a specific order as well as the speaker will be emitting a particular sound, both of this signifying the start of an arming sequence for the detonator. When the detonator is thrown and it hits an object, the LEDâ€™s will all be on at the same time and the speaker will emit an explosion sound.
