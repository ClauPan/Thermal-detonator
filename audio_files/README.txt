In order for the audio files to work with the DFR0299 DFPlayer Mini, the file name needs to be 4 digits, for example "0001.mp3" and placed under a folder named "mp3". 

!! IMPORTANT !!

The order in which the files are added to the mp3 folder matters. The first file added will play first when function play(1); is called.
